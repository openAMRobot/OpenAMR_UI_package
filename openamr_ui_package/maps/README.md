# About

This folder hosts the maps, both as a png image and as a yaml file meant to be read by the
**map_server**

# Installing maps

In this folder, only the placeholder map is present. Additional maps are created by using the **Build
map** button in the UI. However, it is possible to download and install preexisting maps:

1: In the ROS2 **install** folder, locate the packageâ€™s share directory (which should be named
**openamr_ui_package** ) and go to the map folder.

2: Create a group folder and copy the map components inside

3: Go to the path folder and create a folder both for the group, and inside of it, another empty folder
for the map (make sure both names match each others)
